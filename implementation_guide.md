## 📋 What's New: Critical Improvements

### 🔧 Resolution Problem: SOLVED
- **Old**: 48.8m per pixel (sites become 2-8 pixel blurs)
- **New**: Multi-scale approach: 97m → 9.8m → 1.95m per pixel
- **Result**: Archaeological features clearly visible and measurable

### 📊 Data Sources: CHECKPOINT 2 COMPLIANT
- **Old**: Single source (Sentinel-2 optical only)
- **New**: Dual independent sources (Sentinel-2 + ALOS PALSAR radar)
- **Result**: Meets "two independent public sources" requirement

### 🏛️ Archaeological Knowledge: INTEGRATED
- **Old**: Generic AI prompts with no context
- **New**: Casarabe culture knowledge base with specific features
- **Result**: AI understands what to look for (defensive rings, platform mounds, causeways)

### 🔄 Progressive Analysis: IMPLEMENTED
- **Old**: Tries to analyze entire 50km regions at once
- **New**: Regional (50km) → Zone (10km) → Site (2km) progression
- **Result**: Finds networks, not just isolated features

### 🤖 AI Integration: ENHANCED
- **Old**: Single generic prompt
- **New**: Scale-specific prompts + discovery leveraging
- **Result**: AI gets better as it learns from discoveries

## 🏛️ Archaeological Knowledge Integration

### Casarabe Culture (500-1400 CE)
Based on Prümers et al. (2022) Nature paper:

#### Primary Centers (100-400 hectares)
- Multiple concentric defensive rings (2-3)
- Central platform areas (22+ hectares)
- Pyramid mounds (20+ meters tall)
- Multiple causeways radiating outward
- Examples: Cotoca (147 ha), Landívar (315 ha)

#### Secondary Centers (20-40 hectares)
- Single defensive ring
- Rectangular platform (2-6 ha)
- Connected to primary centers
- 2-5km from primary sites

#### Infrastructure Networks
- Causeways: 10-30m wide, perfectly straight
- Length: 2-5km connections between sites
- Orientation: North-Northwest preferred
- Function: Connect hierarchical settlement tiers

---

## 🔬 Multi-Scale Analysis Approach

### Scale 1: Regional Network Detection (50km × 50km)
- **Resolution**: 512×512 pixels (97m per pixel)
- **Purpose**: Find settlement clusters and major causeways
- **AI Task**: Identify ancient urban networks
- **Output**: Priority zones for detailed analysis

### Scale 2: Zone Site Identification (10km × 10km)
- **Resolution**: 1024×1024 pixels (9.8m per pixel)
- **Purpose**: Locate individual archaeological sites
- **AI Task**: Detect geometric patterns and earthworks
- **Output**: Site candidates with confidence scores

### Scale 3: Site Feature Confirmation (2km × 2km)
- **Resolution**: 1024×1024 pixels (1.95m per pixel)
- **Purpose**: Detailed mapping and classification
- **AI Task**: Measure features and confirm sites
- **Output**: Precise coordinates and site tiers

## 🤖 AI Integration Details

### OpenAI API Setup
```python
# Store your API key securely
import keyring
keyring.set_password("openai", "openai_key", "sk-your-key-here")

# The system automatically retrieves it
api_key = keyring.get_password("openai", "openai_key")
client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)
```

### Enhanced Prompting Strategy
1. **Scale-Specific Prompts**: Different prompts for each analysis scale
2. **Archaeological Context**: Casarabe culture knowledge integrated
3. **Progressive Learning**: Later prompts use earlier discoveries
4. **Multi-Source Analysis**: Prompts reference both optical and radar data

### Sample AI Interaction
```
Regional Prompt: "Identify Casarabe settlement networks in this archaeological heatmap..."
AI Response: "Found 3 major settlement clusters with linear connecting features..."

Zone Prompt: "Analyze this 10km zone for individual sites with concentric rings..."
AI Response: "Detected circular earthwork 150m diameter with 2 defensive rings..."

Leverage Prompt: "Using discovered pattern of 150m sites with 2 rings, find similar..."
AI Response: "Found 2 additional sites matching this signature pattern..."
```
