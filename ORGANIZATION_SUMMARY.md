## Enhanced Discovery Information

### Geographic Context
Each discovery now includes:
- **Country identification** (Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, etc.)
- **Regional specification** (Upper Xingu Basin, Ucayali Basin, etc.)
- **River basin assignment** (Xingu, Tapajós, Ucayali, etc.)
- **Nearest major city** (Canarana, Pucallpa, Rio Branco, etc.)
- **Administrative level** (State/Province, River Basin, Regional)
- **Coordinate precision** (WGS84, ±10m resolution)

### Cultural Context
- **Primary culture identification** (Casarabe, Upper Xingu, Ucayali groups)
- **Time period estimation** (500-1400 CE, 800-1500 CE, etc.)
- **Cultural affiliation** (earthwork builders, plaza village complex)
- **Regional network role** (hub, node, peripheral settlement)
- **Comparable sites status** (known sites vs. undocumented areas)

### Site Classification
- **Enhanced tier system** (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary with scoring)
- **Functional analysis** (ceremonial center, fortified settlement, residential)
- **Complexity assessment** (High, Moderate, Simple structure)
- **Preservation status** (Well preserved, Moderately preserved, Degraded)
- **Archaeological significance** (Major discovery, Significant settlement, Notable site)

### Research Potential
- **Excavation priority** (High, Medium, Low based on multiple factors)
- **Scientific significance** assessment
- **Research questions** tailored to site type and cultural context
- **Conservation urgency** (High urgency, Medium urgency, Standard monitoring)

## Summary

**This organization transforms the project from a collection of "enhanced_*" development files into a professional, maintainable, and competition-ready archaeological discovery system. The clean structure combined with detailed archaeological context makes it suitable for academic publication, team collaboration, and long-term maintenance.**

**The enhanced archaeological discoveries now include comprehensive country, regional, cultural, and research context that makes each discovery a complete archaeological record suitable for scientific publication and field investigation planning.**

**Status: ✅ Organization Complete - Ready for Production Use with Enhanced Archaeological Context**
